physicians see more low \nback pain than any other specialist\nThird most common surgical \nindication\n65-80% of the population will \nexperience low back pain in \ntheir lifetime97% are mechanical causes\n75-80% of mechanical causes are considered “lumbar sprain/strain”, meaning that no \nobjective cause is found for the pain\nObesity and smoking seem to be associated with increased risk of low back pain\nOther causes include degenerative joint disease, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, \nspondylolisthesis\n3% or less are secondary to neoplasm, inflammatory diseases, infection, visceral \nreferred pain\nEven though these are rare, you don’t want to miss them!!!\n67DIAGNOSISOften made by ruling out severe disease based \non history, exam, or diagnostic tests\nBe extremely watchful for red flags\nBack pain for less than 6 weeks is considered acute, 6 -12 weeks is subacute (aka subchronic ), \nand greater than 12 weeks is considered chronic\n30-60% resolve in one week\n60-90% resolve in 6 -8 weeks\n8910URGENT/EMERGENT \nCAUSES\nCauda Equina Syndrome\nMedical emergency that results from a \nlesion compressing the bundle of nerve roots at the lower end of the spinal cord\nOnly occurs in 0.04% of LBP cases\nNerve root compression results in low back pain, unilateral or bilateral sciatica, saddle anesthesia (75%), genitourinary dysfunction (90%), and leg paresis that may be asymmetric\nMost commonly caused by acute disc herniation\nURGENT – surgical spinal decompression of \na mass lesion is indicated to prevent permanent neurologic damage\n11Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)\nHighly associated with smoking and atherosclerosis\nAlso common in those with connective tissue \ndiseases (e.g. Marfan’s)\nAlmost 75% of patient with AAA are asymptomatic\nCondition is discovered on routine examination or luckily when ordering studies for other symptoms\nDiagnosis of AAA should be considered in the differential of the following symptoms:\nAbdominal pain radiating to back\nBack or flank pain\nPulsatile abdominal mass\nDiagnose via pulsatile mass on exam and imaging via ultrasound or abdominal CT\nTreatment is surgery if greater than 5.5cm\nTreatment is EMERGENT if there is a rupture of the aneurysm\n12\nProstate cancer\nOften metastasizes to the lumbar spine\nMay be a rare cause of low back pain\nAsk for personal or family history of cancer and cancer screening status\nProstate exam reveals firm nodules\nLaboratory studies reveal elevated PSA\nSpine may have bony tenderness to palpation/percussion\nUrolithiasis\nPain starts in the flank and generally radiates down patient’s side and into groin\nSome patients also experience nausea/vomiting\nCan have blood in urine (hematuria)\nExam will often reveal costovertebral angle or flank tenderness\nPatient unable to get in comfortable position due to pain\nNon- contrast CT of abdomen and pelvis is imaging study of choice\n13Visually inspect\nEspecially prominent spinous process may be spondylolisthesis\nLumbar scoliosis commonly associated with herniated disc (herniation of nucleus \npulposus)\nUneven iliac crests (palpate) may indicate leg length discrepancy\nCheck active and passive ROM\nWith internal disc derangement – pain with flexion common\nDeviation to one side with forward flexion may indicate posterolateral disc bulge\nExtension (standing) often alleviates if disc derangement is present   \nMay worsen if acute herniation\nLocalized unilateral paralumbar pain with extension may be facet syndrome\nCheck hips with Patrick’s test (FABERE)\nHip/SI pathology can often present as low back pain\n14Reflexes\nStrength\nSensation\nSpecial Tests\nStraight Leg Raise\nPulls on sciatic nerve and causes a \nradicular pain if inflamed\n1516Special Test Indication\nKemp’s test (e.g. Quadrant Test, Extension \nRotation test)facet syndrome\nHip-drop Test lumbar sidebending  restriction\nTrendelenburg sign hip abductor weakness (glut medius/minimus)\nStraight leg raise (LaSegue’s  Test)\n•Braggard’s Modificationlumbar radiculopathy\nSlump Test lumbar radiculopathy\nToe-heel walk test L4/L5/S1 motor functionPain can be generated from:\nDisc annulus\nInflammatory chemicals from the nucleus pulposus can create chemical irritation\nMuscles ligaments, tendons, and periosteum\nDura mater and epidural veins\nNerves\nReferred pain\nThis is why knowing your anatomy and having great physical exam skills is so \nimportant to your differential diagnosis!!\n17Spondylosis\nIncludes degenerative changes in both the \ndiscovertebral joints and the facet joints\nThese degenerative or osteoarthritic changes are seen radiographically as:\nDisc or joint space narrowing\nSubchondral sclerosis\nOsteophytosis \nSpondylolysis\nA defect/fracture in the pars interarticularis that is most commonly seen at L5. \nIt is typically a fatigue fracture acquired early in life that is more commonly seen in boys. \nSpondylolysis progresses to spondylolisthesis in approximately 15% of patients \nSpondylolisthesis\nThe anterior displacement of a vertebra on the one beneath it\nGraded 1 to 5\n 1819\nFrom irritation of spinal nerve\nOccurs due to lateral recess stenosis, typically \nresulting from a posterior disc protrusion in \ncombination with superior articular facet \nhypertrophy\nPresents with radicular pain (sharp/electric pain)\nPain is in a dermatomal distribution\nHerniated discs usually compress the more INFERIOR nerve root\nFor example: L4/5 disc herniates and compresses the \nL5 nerve root\n95% of disc herniations occur at L4/5 or L5/S1\n20\nA disc bulge is a symmetric, circumferential extension of disc material beyond the \ninterspace\nA disc herniation is a focal or asymmetric extension of the nucleus pulposus beyond the interspace\nHerniation usually occurs posterolaterally\nHerniations can repair themselves\nMost do within 6 months\nUnless it is causing nerve compression, it may not be the cause of the back pain\nOver 25% of people WITHOUT low back pain have disc herniation on MRI\nInflammatory chemicals from the nucleus pulposus can irritate the nerves and lead to pain\n21Dull back pain that is worse in the morning and usually \nbegins before are 40\nStiffness in nature that is worse with rest and improves with activity\nX-ray may reveal bamboo spine, MRI may detect earlier \nchanges\nEventual fusion of SI joints also seen on X -ray\nOften associated with enthesitis of Achilles/plantar fascia or dactylitis\nHLA -B27 positive in 85- 95% of cases\n22Earlier use of Imaging for low back pain without associated symptoms is not \nassociated with improved outcomes but increases the use of invasive procedures.\nImaging often shows abnormal findings in adults without low back pain, \nwhich can make it difficult to correlate symptoms with imaging findings.\nDisc herniations on MRI are seen in 22 to 67 percent of asymptomatic adults \nand spinal stenosis in 21 percent of asymptomatic adults over age 60.\n23Plain radiographs \n1)AP - Disc, Degeneration, spinal curvature\n2)Lateral  - Disc, Degeneration, Stenosis\n3)Oblique - Pars interarticularis (Increase risk of radiation exposure in \nWomen)\n4)Flexion -Extension  - Instability or surgical fusions \n241)Lumbar MRI without Contrast - Normal and pathologic discs, \nligaments, nerve roots, epidural fat, size and shape of spinal canal.  More \nsensitive and specific for spinal infections and malignancy. \n2)Abdominal/Pelvic CT  - For those who cannot undergo MRI\n3)Lumbar Radionuclide scans - Alternative for MRI if Osteomyelitis is a \nconcern\n4)Lumbar Myelography (contrast dye in spinal canal + X- rays)  - if not \nable to do an MRI or a CT\n2526An inflammatory condition of the pubic symphysis and \nsurrounding structures\nOccurs most often in athletes but can occur in non- athletes \nsecondary to pelvic stress (trauma, pelvic surgery, pregnancy)\nHistory/Signs & Symptoms\nNo trauma generally\nGradual onset\nPain centralized in groin, sometimes with radiation\nPain in the morning or after exercise\nEtiology\nExact cause unclear\nLikely due to repetitive trauma and/or shearing forces\nMore common in soccer, ice hockey, football, long distance runners, weightlifters\n27Physical Exam\nExam can be non -specific and can vary\nLocalized tenderness often seen\nPain with passive abduction, active adduction, and internal rotation of the \nhip often seen\nDiagnostics\nX-ray would be 1st diagnostic test\nMay be incidental finding on asymptomatic individuals as \nwell\nBone scan \nUsed for early detection if not seen on X- ray\nCT or MRI sometimes useful to not only pick up osteitis pubis but also help \ndifferentiate other causes of the pain\n28\n Treatment\n Generally self limiting\n Avoid aggravating factors\n OMT\n NSAIDs\n Physical therapy to strengthen any weakened areas contributing to disease\n Steroid injection\n Surgery (rare)\nRare and extreme measure\nOutcomes not always the best or ideal, reserved for only sever cases\n Return to Play\n Return to sports varies but on average is 9 months and pain lasts as long as 2 years\n Generally, pain is the limiting factor\n29Term “Sports Hernia” is being phased out and now thought more of as an \nabdominal muscle injury of sorts\nGroin pain (often in an athlete) with NO verifiable hernia\nEtiology\nCause is multifactorial but often involves injury/disruption of the external \noblique muscle aponeurosis  with accompanying ilioinguinal nerve \ninjury \nMost common amongst ice hockey and soccer players\nTypical duration of symptoms before diagnosis can range from 6 weeks to 5 years, with a 20 month average\nHistory/Signs & Symptoms\nGenerally, no specific inciting event\nGradual worsening, poorly localized groin pain worse with activity\nAs it worsens, eventually not able to fully stride or turn quickly without stab of pain\nPain may radiate\nHalf report pain with coughing\n30\nPhysical Exam\nDifficult to detect\nNo recognizable hernia palpated\nMay have tenderness worse over pubic tubercle on \naffected side\nDiagnostics\nNo definitive test is the gold standard\nGenerally will start ruling out other disease process with X -ray and ultrasound\nMRI is typically used next but may not pick it up\nDiagnosis often made by exclusion, by history and physical, and by failure of conservative treatment\nEssentially, a diagnosis only confirmed at surgery\n31Treatment\nRest and Physical Therapy\nWell -designed program focused on strength, mobility, \ncoordination, and mechanics of the pelvis/hip/lower \nextremities\nSurgery\nIf symptoms don’t resolve with rest and PT\nFor high- performance athletes unwilling to accept \nlengthy delays in return to sport\nReturn to Play\n87% return to play within 2 months of surgery and \nthe remaining 13% are improved\n32\nA group of disorders caused by injury or \nweakness of the muscles/connective tissues of \nthe pelvic area\nDifferent types:\nUrinary incontinence\nFecal incontinence\nPelvic organ prolapse\nPelvic pain syndromes\nRisk factors: \nPregnancy/childbirth\nPelvic trauma\nObesity\nChronic constipation\nAge\nConnective tissue disorders\nSurgery\nDiagnosis and treatments vary tremendously\n33\nDegenerative condition of the \nsacroiliac joint resulting in lower \nback pain\nFrequently overlooked -> makes up \n15-30% of LBP in the outpatient \nsetting\nRisk factors:\nPrevious lumbar spine fusion\nPregnancy and vaginal delivery\nPrevious trauma to pelvis\nPrior iliac crest bone graft harvestingMechanism is often idiopathic\nBelieved to result from repetitive \ntrauma to SI joint\nPossible pain generators :\nLigamentous/capsule tension\nCompression or shear forces\nHypo or hypermobility\nAbnormal joint mechanics\nMyofascial or kinetic chain imbalances\nInflammation\n34Symptoms :\nPain usually just inferior to PSIS\nWearing a tight belt may improve symptoms\nExam : \nMay have antalgic gait\nFocal tenderness at sacral sulcus or PSIS\nHip and knee exam normal\nNeurovascularly intact\nSpecial tests:\nFABER -> pain localized to SI joint\nGaenslen’s  test\nSI compression test\n35\nImaging :\nPelvis X -rays \nMRI to r/o other etiologies\nTreatment :

:\nInspection:\nBody habitus\nGait\nLeg length discrepancy\nRange of motion:  \nLack of full extension\nLack of full flexion\nLimited internal rotation\nNeuro:\nStraight leg test negative\n39Tonnis  Classification\nGrade 0 •Normal radiographs\nGrade 1 •Sclerosis of femoral head and acetabulum\n•Slight joint space narrowing\n•Slight lipping at joint margins\nGrade 2 •Small cysts in femoral head/acetabulum\n•Moderate joint space narrowing\n•Moderate loss of head sphericity\nGrade 3 •Large cysts in femoral head/acetabulum\n•Joint space obliteration/severe narrowing\n•Severe femoral head deformity vs. AVN40\nRadiographs:\n•Standing AP pelvis\n•AP + lateral hip41Pre-treatment : \n•Younger patients with hip OA should be evaluated for abnormal hip morphology (i.e. femoroacetabular  impingement \nand acetabular dysplasia)\n•Can benefit from early intervention with activity modification and physical therapy\n•Early referral to orthopedic surgeon for possible joint -preserving surgery\nNon -pharmacologic:\n•Exercise \n•Physical therapy\n•Walking aids\n•Weight managementPharmacologic :\n•Oral NSAIDs (first line)\n•Limit use of intra -articular \nglucocorticoids\n•Uncertain benefit:\n•Duloxetine\n•Glucosamine/chondroitin\n•Acetaminophen\n•Hyaluronic acid injections\n•Acupuncture\n•PRP injections\n•OpioidsSurgery : \n•If failed non -surgical tx + \nadvanced structural OA + \nsymptoms impacting QOL\n•Options:\n•Arthroscopic debridement\n•Acetabular/femoral osteotomy\n•Femoral head resection\n•Hip resurfacing\n•Total hip arthroplasty (THA)Abnormal development of the hip joint \nresulting in a shallow acetabulum with lack of anterior and lateral coverage\nLeads to overload of the acetabular rim leading to secondary OA\nDiagnosis is made with plain radiographs\nTreatment typically involves peri -acetabular \nosteotomies  (repositioning the acetabulum to \nbetter cover femoral head) or total hip \narthroplasty  for those presenting with end \nstage osteoarthritis\n42Common conditions of the proximal \nfemoral physis that leads to slippage of \nthe metaphysis relative to the epiphysis\nMost commonly seen in adolescent obese \nmales (12 -13yo)\nUsually presents with atraumatic hip pain for several months\nDiagnosis can be confirmed with radiographs of the hip\nTreatment is usually percutaneous pin fixation\n43Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the proximal \nfemoral epiphysis in children\nOsteonecrosis due to disruption of blood supply to femoral head -> revascularization and \nresorption -> later collapse\n“Leg -Can’t -Perfuse”\nInsidious onset of painless limp or intermittent hip/knee/groin/thigh pain\n4-8 years old, M:F ratio 5:1\nDiagnosis can be suspected with hip radiographs but MRI may be required for occult \nor early disease\nTreatment is typically observation in children \n<8yo, and/or pelvic osteotomy in children >8yo \n44Also called hip impingement, FAI is a condition where the hip \njoint is not shaped normally. This causes the pathological contact between femoral head -neck junction and acetabular rim . \nHistory/Signs & Symptoms :\nHip-related groin pain, diffuse and poorly localized\n“C” sign\nCan be acute or chronic\nOne study reports 1/3 of athletes recall a specific traumatic event\nMechanical symptoms in the hip/groin area such as catching or clicking\nSome patients may present with a painful snapping hip syndrome\nStrong risk factor for osteoarthritis\nEtiology :\nCAM deformity likely develops during skeletal maturation as a normal physiological response to load ( primary) vs. due to \npre-existing hip disease or acute trauma ( secondary )\nStructural abnormalities such as femoral acetabular impingement may also place athletes at higher risk for labral pathology\n45\n46\nImaging tests : Tests such as X -rays and MRIs help doctors identify abnormalities \nand signs of damage in the hip joint.\nImpingement test : Your doctor brings your knee up to your chest and rotates it \ntoward the opposite shoulder (FADIR test) . Someone with FAI will feel the same \nkind of pain with this movement.\nLocal anesthetic : A doctor identifies FAI by injecting the hip joint with numbing \nmedicine to see if the injection relieves the pain.\nTreatment : corticosteroid Injections, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs \n(NSAIDs), physical therapy, rest and surgery.\n47\nMechanisms :\n1.Acute trauma usually involving forceful resistance of hip flexion while \nkicking or running\n2.Repetitive microtrauma\nPhysical Exam\nAbnormal gait with shortened stance phase\nReproducible groin pain elicited with forced flexion/adduction \nand internal rotation (FADIR impingement test)\nPain with flexion/abduction and external rotation test (FABER test)\nLimitations of terminal motion of the hip\nDiagnostic Studies\nX-rays may be needed to rule out other pathologies and can \nhelp demonstrate Femoral Acetabular Impingement (FAI)\nMR Arthrogram is the gold standard for diagnosis of a hip labral tear\n48\nTreatment\nInitial treatment includes:\nModification of activities/avoidance of aggravating \nactivities\nOMT/PT\nNSAIDs\nIf that fails…Surgery\nReturn to Play\nProfessionally, earliest return to sport tends to be golfers (average 6 weeks) followed by hockey players and skaters\nBaseball and soccer players average about 12 weeks\nAddressing bony abnormalities during arthroscopic intervention for labral tears may require extended protected \nweight bearing\nMay potentially prolong return to sport\nIf damage extensive enough, retirement ay be necessary\n49Most common cause of lateral hip pain in adults\nRepetitive overload tendinopathy of gluteus medius \nand minimus muscles +/ - bursa involvement\nRisk factors : female sex, obesity, low back pain, \nscoliosis, leg length discrepancy, hip and knee arthritis, and painful foot disorders (i.e. plantar \nfasciitis)\nSymptoms : lateral hip pain near greater trochanter \nthat increases with:\nAmbulation\nProlonged standing\nRising from chair\nClimbing stairs\nWalking up incline\nDirect pressure when lying on side (affecting sleep)\n50\nDiagnosis:\n1.Presence of lateral hip pain\n2.Local tenderness to palpation of the greater \ntrochanter\nExam may also reveal:\nwaddling/Trendelenburg gait \n+ Trendelenburg test\n+ resisted external de- rotation test\nPain with passive adduction + resisted abduction \n+ FABER - > localized pain to lateral hip\n51\nImaging usually unnecessary:\nIf concerned for articular hip pathology - > \nAP radiograph of pelvis\nIf diagnosis unclear or concern for other \nunderlying pathology -> MRI \n52\nMRI: Edema and partial tear of gluteus medius \ntendon insertion at greater trochanter (arrow)Usually a self -limited condition\nTreatment:\nExercises + activity modification\nIsometric loading of gluteus medius, gluteus \nminimus, and quadriceps\nCalf strengthening\nPhysical Therapy\nNSAIDs prn\nLocal glucocorticoid injection \nRefractory symptoms: \nSurgical referral, if:\nNo improvement in >12 months \nGluteus medius tear on MRI\n53\n5455•Most common cause  oflateral knee pain in\nathletes\n•Overuse injury of lateral knee, occurs primarily in \nrunners, cyclists, and military personnel\n•Caused byarepetitive snapping or \nfriction of distal iliotibial band over  \nlateral femoral epicondyle\n•Causing afocal irritation atsiteof \nattachmentSymptoms :\nPain localized to where ITB courses over lateral \nfemoral epicondyle (just proximal to lateral joint line)\nTypically sharp or burning and occurs just prior to foot strike when running, or as knee extends when cycling \nDiagnosis\n: \nDiagnosed clinically based on history and characteristic exam findings\nFocal tenderness at distal ITB over lateral femoral \ncondyle\n+ Noble compression test\n+ Ober’s Test\nThorough need exam to rule out alternative \ncauses\nImaging rarely needed\n56\n57\n•2 types of lower extremity malalignment associated \nwith ITBS:\n1.Weak hip abductors -> increased hip adduction \n(common among novice and female runners)\n2.Increased hip abduction, genu varum, or increased foot supination (common among experienced distance runners)\n•Extrinsic factors:\n•Running on angled surfaces\n•Excessive training\n•Poor running footwear\n•Bicycle with incorrect pedal position or poor fitRest, ice, NSAIDs, corticosteroid \ninjections, OMT\nPhysical therapy and training modifications\nCorrect deficits in muscle strength and \nmobility\nReturn to sport along a graded \nschedule\nFailure of non- operative management: \nsurgical release of fibers from lateral \nretinaculum of knee\n58\n59",
